# ACPred-LAF: a deep learning-based classifier to predict anticancer peptides with learnable and adaptive features



## How to use it

The main program in the $\text{train}$ folder $\text{main.py}$ file. You could change the $\text{load_config}$ function to achieve custom training and testing, such as modifying datasets, setting hyperparameters and so on. File $\text{main.py}$ has detail notes.



The project is mainly implemented through **Pytorch** and **sklearn**. See $\text{requirements.txt}$ for details of dependent packages.
